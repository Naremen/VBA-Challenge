# VBA-Challenge

I started off by breaking up the challenge into multiple different sections.
I first started by working through the VBA code on one worksheet.

I first started off by creating columns, then went to the conditional formatting aspect of the project.
After that I went on to the summary aspect of the challenge to figure out the greatest increase, greatest decrease, and greatest total volume.

Once the code was running on one of the worksheets, I then added code to make it run for each sheet.

While working on the VBA challenge I made sure to use my resources as much as I could.
Me and a couple of my classmates worked on the project over a discord meeting for a couple hours to get us started with the code.

After that, I was still partially confused and used about 15 minutes of my tutoring session for assistance.
I also tried to use the AskBCS section on Slack, but still was having issues with my code even with their assistance.
